#AI Medical Diagnosis Assistant

##An intelligent Jac-powered health assistant that thinks like a doctor.

This project is a smart hospital workflow assistant built using Jac Language and ByLLM (Gemini AI).
It helps simulate a real hospital process — from diagnosis to prescription and patient follow-up — all powered by AI reasoning.

###✨ What It Does

 # Understands Symptoms – You describe how you feel, and the AI suggests possible tests.
 # Analyzes Diagnosis – It recommends medication based on your diagnosis.
 # Prescribes Drugs – Automatically suggests appropriate treatments.
 # Takes Feedback – Listens to your response after treatment.
 # Gives Follow-up Advice – Advises whether you’ve recovered or should return to hospital.

####⚙️ How to Run Locally

Make sure you’ve installed Jac and ByLLM first.

Then run the file:
  '''bash
 jac run gen_ai_assignement.jac
