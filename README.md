\#  Jac Practice Playground



This repository contains my practice code in \*\*Jac language\*\* as I learn and experiment with different concepts.  

The main file, `hello.jac`, includes simple programs such as \*\*Hello World\*\* and a \*\*Number Guessing Game\*\*.





---



\##  What's Inside?



&nbsp; 1. Hello World üåç

A very first program in Jac, showing how to use the `entry` block to run code.



&nbsp; 2. Number Guessing Game



A fun console game where the computer picks a random number between 1 and 10, and the player has to guess it within limited attempts.

The game gives feedback if the guess is too high or too low.





\### How to Run

1. Install Jac.

2\. Clone this repository:git clone https://github.com/your-username/jac-practice.git

cd jac-practice

3\. Run the file: jac run hello.jac



\#### Why This Repo?



&nbsp;1. To document my journey of learning Jac programming.

&nbsp;2. To practice coding basics (classes, objects, inheritance, input handling).

&nbsp;3. To try fun mini-projects while building confidence.
